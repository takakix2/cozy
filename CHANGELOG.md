# Changelog

## v0.2.15

### Highlights

- **A cramped footer now offers `^Q Quit` where it used to offer `^X Exit`.** The two
  keys look like different answers and are almost the same one: `^X` and `^S` both
  land in the identical `File:` prompt, and only diverge after you press Enter. So on
  a narrow screen one of those two slots was spent saying the same thing twice, while
  the key that does something genuinely different — leave *without* saving — was not
  shown at all.

  That matters most exactly where the room is smallest. cozy runs inside a phone
  terminal, where dropping to a shell to sort it out is not the easy escape it is on
  a desktop, so the way out belongs on screen.

  Only the two cramped layouts changed: the single-row footer (three slots) and the
  narrow two-row one (under 80 columns). At full width `^X Exit` stays — nano's
  muscle memory is worth keeping where there is room for both — and the four-row
  layout already showed both.

  ⚠️ **No key was removed.** `^X` still exits; it is only off the sign.

## v0.2.14

### Highlights

- **The Save and Open prompts show `~` again instead of the resolved path.** cozy
  holds the file it opened as an absolute path, so pressing `Ctrl+S` on a file you
  opened as `~/notes.md` used to answer `File: [/home/you/notes.md]`. On a desktop
  that is merely verbose. Inside the phone app it is a leak: the host rewrites the
  path into the sandbox's real location before cozy sees it, so the prompt was
  spelling out `/data/data/com.hsh.mobile/files/notes.md` — a container path the
  shell around it deliberately never shows, and one you cannot usefully type.

  `~` had only ever worked in the *typing* direction (v0.2.12). This is the other
  half: a path under `$HOME` is shortened for display, and `Enter` expands it back,
  so the string on screen and the file that gets written are the same thing.

  Only whole path components match — with `HOME=/home/al`, `/home/alice/x` stays
  as it is rather than becoming `~ice/x`. A `HOME` of `/` never shortens: turning
  every path into `~/…` would make `~` mean nothing.

  ⚠️ The shortening happens where the prompt's buffer is seeded, not where it is
  drawn. That buffer is what you then edit, so shortening at draw time would leave
  the cursor pointing into a different string than the one on screen.

## v0.2.13

> ⓘ **0.2.12 never reached crates.io.** The version was bumped in the repository but
> not published, so what it described — the swap flushed on focus loss, and `~` in
> cozy's own prompts — ships here instead. Upgrading from 0.2.11 gets both releases
> at once.

### Highlights

- **Saving into a directory that does not exist now asks instead of refusing.**
  `Ctrl+S` on `~/.ssh/config` when there is no `~/.ssh` used to stop with
  `Directory not found` and leave you to quit, run `mkdir -p`, and start again.
  It now offers one line — `Create directory ~/.ssh? — [Enter] create  [Esc] cancel`
  — in the same shape as the swap-recovery offer: one line, two keys, anything
  else ignored.

  The two ends of this were both wrong to pick on their own. Creating it silently
  is what a typo does not deserve: `~/.shh/config` is a slip, and the whole value
  of the question is that you see the directory spelled out before it exists.
  Refusing is what nano and vim do, and it is defensible on a desktop where the
  shell is one `Ctrl+Z` away — but cozy also runs inside a phone app, where the
  shell you would drop to is a few centimetres wide. So it asks.

  Cancelling stays in the Save prompt with the typed name intact, because a wrong
  directory usually means a wrong name. `Ctrl+Q` still quits while the question is
  open — a prompt that swallows the quit key traps you, and the swap already holds
  the buffer.

## v0.2.12

### Highlights

- **The swap is written on the way out, not one tick later.** The cadence writes
  about a second after you stop typing, so a kill landing inside that second took
  the keystrokes with it. Nothing warns before a kill — but something does say when
  the app leaves the screen, and that moment was going unused. `Event::FocusLost`
  now flushes the swap on the spot. No new API was needed: losing focus already
  means "you are about to stop being the thing in front of the user", so a host
  that leaves the screen sends it, and a terminal that reports focus gives the CLI
  the same thing for free.

### Fixes

- **`~` works in the editor's own prompts.** Typing a home-relative path into
  Save As or Open — `~/.hshrc`, `~/notes.md` — failed with `Directory not found`,
  because cozy never expanded the tilde itself. Nothing was wrong on the command
  line: there the shell expands `~` before cozy ever sees it. But cozy's prompts
  have no shell in front of them, so the path was taken literally and read as a
  relative one containing a directory named `~`. `vim` (`:e ~/x`) and `nano` both
  expand it themselves, and cozy now does too — the bare `~`, and `~/…`. A
  `~user` prefix has no resolution here and is left alone, as is a `~` anywhere
  but the front, which turns up in ordinary filenames.

  This had been true since the first commit and shipped in every release. It
  stayed hidden because the common path — `cozy <file>`, then `Ctrl+S` — never
  involves a tilde reaching cozy. It surfaced on iOS, where the editor is called
  in-process and no word expansion happens anywhere, so even the command line
  arrived with the tilde intact.

## v0.2.11

### Highlights

- **Unsaved work survives a kill.** cozy now keeps a swap file — a snapshot of the
  buffer, written about a second after you stop typing (and every 200 keystrokes if
  you never stop). Open the file again after a crash, a `kill -9`, or an iOS app
  eviction, and cozy offers the edits back on one line: `[Enter]` restores,
  `[Esc]` discards. Restoring loads the buffer and leaves it unsaved — the file on
  disk is not touched until you say so.

  The swap is not a `.swp` beside your file: it lives in a state directory
  (`~/.local/state/cozy/swap`, or the host's config dir when embedded), so it
  cannot dirty a git worktree and works when the file's directory is read-only.
  It is removed on save and on a deliberate quit — it exists for the exits you
  did not choose — and an unclaimed one is swept after 14 days.

  This is vim's model, not nano's, and deliberately so: nano writes its emergency
  copy when a signal arrives, but iOS kills a backgrounded app with SIGKILL, where
  no handler runs at all. The only writes that survive are the ones already made.

### Fixes

- Saving through a symlink whose target does not exist yet (a dotfiles repo not
  cloned on this machine, a target deleted a moment ago) replaced the link with a
  regular file. The link is now followed to where it points, and the file is
  written there.

## v0.2.10

### Highlights

- Added a compact / low-spec host mode via the `COZY_COMPACT` environment
  variable (set it to anything but empty or `0`). When on, cozy uses the
  lightweight bordered welcome (a centered, width-capped box — no longer
  stretched edge-to-edge on a wide screen) instead of the block-art logo, and hides line
  numbers by default — both cut the number of cells redrawn each frame, which
  matters on full-repaint GPUs (e.g. an Android tablet's Mali-G52 driven by
  hsh-ios). The host sets it; cozy can't detect the GPU itself. A runtime
  `Ctrl+L` toggle still turns line numbers on even under compact.

## v0.2.9

### Highlights

- Added tree-sitter syntax highlighting for Markdown source (`.md`/`.markdown`)
  in the edit view, so headings, bold/italic emphasis, inline code, list/quote
  markers, and link URLs are colored while you type — not only in the
  `ratatui-markdown` preview. Colors mirror VS Code's Dark+ theme (blue
  headings/bold, purple italics, orange inline code, light-blue list markers,
  green quote markers; fenced-code-block contents stay the default color).
  Markdown uses a two-grammar parser (block + inline) via `tree-sitter-md`; the
  highlighter backend was generalized to drive it. Bumped the core `tree-sitter`
  dependency to 0.26 (required by `tree-sitter-md`).
- Refreshed the edit-mode and glide-mode README screenshots to show the new
  Markdown source highlighting.

## v0.2.8

### Highlights

- Reorganized the Help screen: split the cross-mode shortcuts out of "Edit Mode"
  into new "View" (line numbers, wrap, footer, Markdown preview) and "Global"
  (command palette, help) sections, and added the previously missing `Ctrl+L`,
  `Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+U`, and `Ctrl+P` entries. Fixed column alignment on the
  multi-key rows.

## v0.2.7

### Highlights

- Added tree-sitter syntax highlighting for TypeScript (`.ts`/`.mts`/`.cts`/
  `.tsx`) and Go (`.go`). TypeScript inherits the JavaScript highlight query so
  keywords, strings, and comments are covered alongside the TS-specific nodes.

## v0.2.6

### Highlights

- Replaced the line-by-line regex syntax highlighter with tree-sitter (new
  default `treesitter` feature). Multi-line strings and block comments are now
  highlighted correctly, and highlights are computed for the visible window on
  change instead of per line on every frame.
- Function names are now highlighted (light blue). Disable the `treesitter`
  feature to fall back to the regex highlighter for a lighter embedded build.

## v0.2.5

### Highlights

- Added `F3` as a tmux-safe Browse shortcut. tmux's default prefix is `Ctrl+B`,
  which it swallows before cozy sees it, so Browse was unreachable inside tmux.
  `Ctrl+B` still works outside tmux.
- The in-app Help screen now lists the fallback keys (`Ctrl+B / F3` for Browse,
  `Ctrl+H / F1` for Help) so they are discoverable without crowding the footer.

## v0.2.4

### Highlights

- Fixed sluggish typing and shortcut response when editing highlighted files.
  Syntax highlighter regex sets are now compiled once per language instead of
  on every visible line on every frame.

## v0.2.3

### Highlights

- Added a mobile footer visibility toggle for low-height embedded terminals.
- Tightened one-row and compact footer layouts for iPhone-sized `hsh-ios`
  sessions.
- Kept search, goto, save, open, quit, and replace prompts usable when footer
  height is constrained.

## v0.2.2

### Highlights

- Refactored host boundaries for hsh-ios embedding: input, file I/O, config I/O,
  clipboard I/O, and startup runtime are now isolated from reducer/editor logic.
- Documented the planned session-diff workflow.

## v0.2.1

### Highlights

- Enabled Mermaid diagram rendering in Markdown preview.

## v0.2.0

### Highlights

- Added configurable footer and status bar colors via `config.toml`.
- Color settings accept named terminal colors and `#RRGGBB` true color values.
- Markdown preview now uses `ratatui-markdown` for rendered wrapping and code blocks.

## v0.1.15

### Highlights

- Added Markdown preview mode (`F2`) for rendered, read-only reading of Markdown documents.
- Supported fast reading controls in Markdown preview:
  - Navigation via `j`/`k` or `Up`/`Down`.
  - Page navigation via `PageUp`/`PageDown`.
  - Document jumps via `gg`/`G`, `Ngg`/`NG`.
  - Screen jumps via `H`/`M`/`L` (top/middle/bottom).
  - Counted movements (e.g. `5j`, `5gg`).
  - Easy return to the configured home mode using `Esc`.

## v0.1.8

### Highlights

- Documentation and presentation only (no code changes): lead the READMEs with the **Comfort First TUI** tagline, add a welcome-screen screenshot, and align the crate description with the comfort-first positioning.

## v0.1.7

### Highlights

- Added `default_mode` config option to choose your resting mode: `"edit"` (default, type like nano) or `"glide"` (navigate like vim). It governs every action's return target, not just startup — with Glide home, `Esc` round-trips back to Glide like vim's normal mode. Edit-entry verbs (`i`/`a`/`o`, change) still enter Edit regardless. Opt-in; newcomers keep zero hidden state.

### Validation

- `cargo test`: 79 tests passed.

## v0.1.6

### Highlights

- Added `cozy --version` and `cozy -V` for install verification without opening the TUI.
- Split Browse mode footer shortcuts into separate arrow-key and `hjkl` rows.

### Validation

- `cargo test`: 70 tests passed.

## v0.1.5

### Highlights

- Added Browse mode for opening directories and navigating a file tree.
- Improved save behavior for new buffers and relative filenames.
- Added collision-safe default save names such as `untitled (1).txt`.
- Updated README positioning around cozy as a small `nano` alternative with optional vim-like navigation.

### Validation

- `cargo test`: 70 tests passed.

## v0.1.4

- Added crates.io and license badges to the README files.
